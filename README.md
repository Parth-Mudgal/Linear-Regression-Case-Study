# Geely Autos - Multiple Linear Regression Case Study

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a multiple linear regression case study on Geely Autos. The aim of this project is to build a predictive model to to understand the factors on which the pricing of cars depends in the US market.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this case study is sourced from 'UpGrad'. It includes various features such as car width, engine size, bore ratio, stroke, engine location, engine type, price, etc.

## Files

- **Geely_Autos_Case_Study.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis, preprocessing, and multiple linear regression modeling.

- **CarPriceData.csv**: CSV file containing the dataset used in the analysis.

## Methodology

1. **Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset to understand its structure, missing values, and statistical summaries.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.

3. **Multiple Linear Regression Model**: Build and train a multiple linear regression model to predict car prices based on selected features.

4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
